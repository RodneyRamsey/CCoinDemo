Sitting #1: August 14, 2013
> Git clone'd CCoin-agent, Crypto, ECDSA, Electrum, and KDF
> Added Address, Wallet, and Account classes into CCoinDemo.py
> Wallet stores the session and handles commands
> Address stores an ECDSA and a Base-58 pub-priv keypair
> Account stores addresses and handles saving, registering, logging in, and encryption
> Partway through bug crunching my mouse runs out of battery, and all the batteries in my house are dead.
> Good thing I know shortcuts for everything B) #sweg
> Util.py handles all utility stuff including conversion and encryption

Need to add:
> Check balance
> Send
> Pretty much everything. Hah.

Sitting #2: August 14, 2013
> Added get balance via blockchain.info
> Still dont have a battery ):
> Although, when I said I know shortcuts for everything, I wasn't kidding
> I literally have not used a mouse for 3 hours and I'm getting around perfectly.
> Partway through implementing coloured bit
> Bass on my subwoofers shake my bamboo plant off my shelf
> It falls on a plate that I was eating
> Shatters it. Pieces of broken plate fly everywhere, and water too
> I yell "FUCK", get up, wipe off the water and plate from the desk
> Pick up the pieces of plate and throw it away
> Still tons of shards on the floor
> Get a broom and brush them into the trash
> Thanks Nero, you broke one of my plates, got everything wet, broke one of my bamboos, and interupted my meal and programming session
> Back to programming
> Removed CAWallet from agent.py. I feel it would be better for the wallet to own the colourer agent as a child, as opposed to the agent owning the wallet.
> This way the wallet is centralised on the wallet itself as opposed to updates from the colourer agent.
> I have no idea what outindex is so I sent you an email.
> Reddit while waiting for you to reply. *sigh*
> Began to implement coloured coin support
> Finished
